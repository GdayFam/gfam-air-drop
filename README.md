# gfam-air-drop

This repo is a copy of the gFam multiple receiptent functionality repo.  That repository is currently private because there the git version control data has some information in it we do not want made public. 

This repository enables a user to tip XRP to mulitple receiptents using a batch process.
The user can set the XRP amounts to be sent and the addresses that will receive the XRP.  The user then starts the batch process and the program will send the XRP one by one.

Payments are sent to a hot wallet purely for processing so that this wallet can remain empty when it is not being used.

This process is used by the gFam.live Challenges functionality to reward creators for completing challenges (creating tutorials, sharing on social media, etc).
